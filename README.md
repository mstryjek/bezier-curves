# bezier-curves
C++ classes and functions for fitting Bezier curves of any degree to a set of points.



## A note about file extensions


## Limitations


## TODO
- [ ] README
- [ ] Eventually, python version
- [ ] Nicer drawing colors
- [ ] GIF in README (cubic + quartic curves in one GIF)
- [X] Enable 0-dimensional Bezier curves to allow for fitting quadratic curves and calculating their curvature
- [X] Docstrings
- [X] Compilation warnings
- [X] Shorthand types for BC< T, D, D >
- [X] Different degree tests
- [X] Main tests
- [X] Fix BezierCurve::at() method
- [X] Determine factorial degree+1 at compile time
